❌ Wrong password (4th attempt) → "Invalid credentials. 1 attempt remaining before account lockout."
❌ Wrong password (5th attempt) → "Account is locked due to too many failed login attempts. Please try again in 30 minutes."
```

## 📊 3. Admin Activity Logs (Audit Trail) ✅ BACKEND COMPLETE

### What's Implemented:

  - Action type (LOGIN, USER_CREATED, BOOKING_CANCELLED, etc.)
  - Resource type (user, booking, review, auth, system)
  - Resource ID (which record was affected)
  - IP address and User Agent
  - Timestamp

- ✅ Controller with pagination and filtering
- ✅ Route: GET `/api/activity-logs` (admin only)
- ✅ Helper function `logActivity()` ready for integration

### Next Step:
- The `logActivity()` helper needs to be called from other controllers
- Example: After a user login, booking cancellation, user deletion, etc.
