# Changes Completed - Phase 1

## Date: 2025-10-20

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. ✅ Quote Requests 500 Error
**Problem:** GET `/api/quotes/my` endpoint was missing
**Solution:**
- Added `getMyQuotes` controller method in `backend/src/controllers/quoteController.ts`
- Added route `/api/quotes/my` in `backend/src/routes/quoteRoutes.ts`
- Updated routes to support `superadmin` role

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/controllers/quoteController.ts` - Added getMyQuotes function
- `backend/src/routes/quoteRoutes.ts` - Added /my route, updated auth

#### 2. ✅ Account History - Bookings Tab Added
**Problem:** Bookings were displayed in main dashboard body, not in Account History tabs
**Solution:**
- Added "My Bookings" as first tab in Account History component
- Moved all bookings display logic into Account History
- Bookings now show in dedicated tab with proper status badges

**Files Changed:**
- `my-accuro-website/src/components/AccountHistory.tsx` - Completely rewritten

#### 3. ✅ Purchase History Implementation
**Problem:** Purchase History tab showed "Coming Soon" placeholder
**Solution:**
- Created purchase history service for frontend API calls
- Implemented full purchase history display with order details
- Shows items, pricing breakdown, tracking numbers, order status

**Files Changed:**
- `my-accuro-website/src/services/purchaseHistoryService.ts` - NEW FILE
- `my-accuro-website/src/components/AccountHistory.tsx` - Added purchase rendering

### New Components Created

#### Purchase History Service
**File:** `my-accuro-website/src/services/purchaseHistoryService.ts`
- `getMyPurchases()` - Fetch user's purchase history
- `getById(id)` - Get single purchase details
- `cancelPurchase(id, reason)` - Cancel an order

### Account History Component Updates

**Tab Order (New):**
1. My Bookings (moved from dashboard body)
2. Purchase History (fully implemented)
3. Quote Requests
4. My Reviews
5. Activity Log

- Order status badges (processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled, returned)
- Payment status display
- Detailed itemization for purchases
- Price breakdowns (subtotal, tax, shipping, total)
- Tracking number display

### Remaining Tasks (Next Phase)
