# Vercel Frontend Configuration Fix

## Issue
Environment variable `REACT_APP_API_URL` is set in Vercel but not being used in the build.

## Root Cause
Your frontend is in the `my-accuro-website` folder, but Vercel might be building from the root directory or not properly injecting the environment variable during build time.

## Solution - Check Vercel Project Settings

### Step 1: Verify Root Directory
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your frontend project: **accuro-vercel-sfom**
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Check **Root Directory** setting:
   - Should be: `my-accuro-website`
   - If it's empty or different, change it to `my-accuro-website`
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Verify Build Settings
Still in **Settings** → **General**:
- **Framework Preset**: Should detect "Create React App"
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (or leave as default)
- **Output Directory**: `build` (or leave as default)
- **Install Command**: `npm install` (or leave as default)

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variable Format
Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**:
- **Key**: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
- **Value**: `https://accuro-vercel.vercel.app/api` (make sure no trailing slash after /api)
- **Environments**: All checked (Production, Preview, Development)

### Step 4: Force Clean Rebuild
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click the **three dots (...)** on the latest deployment
3. Select **"Redeploy"**
4. IMPORTANT: Check the box **"Use existing Build Cache"** should be UNCHECKED
5. Click **"Redeploy"**

This forces Vercel to rebuild from scratch with the correct environment variables.

### Step 5: Verify During Build
Watch the build logs in Vercel:
1. Click on the deployment that's building
2. Look for: `Creating an optimized production build...`
3. The environment variable should be injected during this step

## Alternative: Manual Environment Variable Check

If the above doesn't work, you can verify what's in the build:

1. After deployment completes, check the console in your browser
2. Add this temporarily to `src/App.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   console.log('API URL:', process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL);
   ```
3. If it logs `undefined`, the environment variable is not being injected

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Wrong Root Directory
**Symptom**: Build fails or uses wrong files
**Fix**: Set Root Directory to `my-accuro-website` in Vercel settings

### Issue 2: Cached Build
**Symptom**: Changes not reflecting, old API URL still being used
**Fix**: Redeploy without cache (uncheck "Use existing Build Cache")

### Issue 3: Environment Variable Not Scoped
**Symptom**: Works in Development but not Production
**Fix**: Make sure Production environment is checked for the env variable

### Issue 4: Trailing Slash
**Symptom**: API calls go to wrong URL
**Fix**: Remove trailing slash from API URL: `https://accuro-vercel.vercel.app/api` (not `/api/`)

## Expected Result

After correct configuration:
```javascript
// In browser console (src/services/api.ts)
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://accuro-vercel.vercel.app/api'

// All API calls should go to:
https://accuro-vercel.vercel.app/api/activity-logs/my
https://accuro-vercel.vercel.app/api/purchases/my-purchases
https://accuro-vercel.vercel.app/api/reports
// etc.
```

## Quick Test

After redeployment, test one API endpoint:
```bash
# Open browser console on your site
fetch('https://accuro-vercel.vercel.app/api/health')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)

# Should return: {"status":"ok","message":"Server is running"}
```

## Files Updated
- ✅ `my-accuro-website/vercel.json` - Added proper Vercel configuration
- ✅ Triggered fresh deployment with cache clear

## Next Steps
1. Verify Root Directory is set to `my-accuro-website`
2. Redeploy without cache
3. Wait 2-3 minutes
4. Test the site - all 404 errors should be gone!

**If issues persist after this, the problem might be with how Vercel is handling the monorepo structure. Let me know and I can help configure it differently.**
